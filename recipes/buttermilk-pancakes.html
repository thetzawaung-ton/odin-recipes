            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix the dry ingredients: Combine flour, sugar, baking powder,
                    baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the buttermilk, mik, eggs and 
                    melted butter together in a seperate bowl. Do not combine the 
                    wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the pancakes: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients
                    and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended.
                    Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly
                    on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.
                </li>
